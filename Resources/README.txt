Welcome to the Resources Folder in the Bovis-PangenomeOfReservoirs project
Here, these files are outputs used to generate figures for the project.

ProjectBovisReservoir_metadata.csv
This file is a csv that holds metadata information associated with the genomes we downloaded. Namely, Species, Country, and Reservoir status.

mbovis_transposed_report.csv
This file contains the statistics generated from QUAST on the genome assemblies from the analysis.

transposed_report.tsv
This is the original output file of QUAST. I turned this file into a csv using Excel and renamed it mbovis_transposed_report.csv
