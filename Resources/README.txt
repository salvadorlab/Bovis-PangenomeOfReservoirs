Welcome to the Resources Folder in the Bovis-PangenomeOfReservoirs project
Here, these files are outputs used to generate figures for the project.

ProjectBovisReservoir_metadata.csv
This file is a csv that holds metadata information associated with the genomes we downloaded. Namely, Species, Country, and Reservoir status.

mbovis_transposed_report.csv
This file contains the statistics generated from QUAST on the genome assemblies from the analysis.

transposed_report.tsv
This is the original output file of QUAST. I turned this file into a csv using Excel and renamed it mbovis_transposed_report.csv

filtered_mbovis_stats.csv
The assemblies that passed the filtering scheme I created.

mbovis_annot.faa
amino acid protein sequences for M. bovis. 

mbovis_panGWAS.csv
output of Scoary relating to accessory genes presence/absence to reservoir status

mbovis_scory.csv
metadata file for the project adapted to be used in Scoary software

mbovis_transposed_report.csv
QUAST output with all the original assemblies statisitics.

mbovis_prab.csv
output of the Roary software. shows COGs and whether they are core or accessory genes.

mbovis_R_workspace.RData
The info related to figure making scripts in R.

PhylogenyFreeHR.pptx
A diagram of my ideas of the type of software I want to perform based on the alignments of the metadata.

SoftwareSlidingWindow.pptx
A list of softwares that will take alignments and output Homologus Recombination info and Positive Selection info.
