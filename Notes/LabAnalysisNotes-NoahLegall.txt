Write daily. Commit at 5 pm every work day.

##May 5th
TODO: Download all the sequences into the directory
****: the command to download all the sequences is "cat mbov_accessions.txt | xargs fastq-dump --split-3". it might be worth it to create a script for this that can catch errors and run on multiple processors.
****: example of how to put in user input into qsub on sapelo2: qsub -v "reference=/path/to/reference.fa,email=email@uga.edu" ./bacteria_SNP/bacteria_pathogen_SNP.sh
TODO: plots that describe the data (ggplot + patchwork)

#May 8th
TODO: Read literature to get best terminology for if reservoir or not reservoir
****: Incidental Host; a infection that occurs to a species that is not the target species. This makes sense to me, since some of the species are not neccessary to ultimately affect cattle.
****: Ashford R. W. (2003). When is a reservoir not a reservoir?. Emerging infectious diseases, 9(11), 1495â€“1496. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid0911.030088
TODO: Data Cleaning (Read papers to get more insight on data)
****: The only data cleaning that essentially needs to happen is from the 2017 Crispell paper. I need more information on CERVINE label and maybe also the STOAT.
****: PORCINE = Wild Pigs, CERVINE = deer (there are many types of deer in New Zealand)
****: So in the NZ paper, wildlife are considered a maitenance community in general so how should they be labelled
TODO: Create Folder for the Written/Oral Exam
DONE: Read literature to get best terminology for if reservoir or not reservoir -> Incidental Host might be good, but very specific. Frankly, we don't know the relationship each species has to cattle, so putting a uniform label might not make sense. Non-Target Host is a good one too, since it makes a clear distinction between cattle and the main reservoir.
DONE: Data Cleaning (Read papers to get more insight on data). -> Added specific labels to the species tag, also got rid of labels that were synonomous.
DONE: Create Folder for the Written/Oral Exam
