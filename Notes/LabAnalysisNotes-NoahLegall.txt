TODO: Download all the sequences into the directory
****: the command to download all the sequences is "cat mbov_accessions.txt | xargs fastq-dump --split-3". it might be worth it to create a script for this that can catch errors and run on multiple processors.
****: example of how to put in user input into qsub on sapelo2: qsub -v "reference=/path/to/reference.fa,email=email@uga.edu" ./bacteria_SNP/bacteria_pathogen_SNP.sh
TODO: plots that describe the data (ggplot + patchwork)
