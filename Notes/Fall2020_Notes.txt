Fall 2020 Notes

Oct. 1st
TODO: Meeting with Liliana
-> Title needs to be changed to "Characterization of Genome Signiture of Mycobacterium bovis"
-> Very busy slides, less text if possible
-> I don't discuss how animals become infected (goes before talking about reservoirs). Look up transmission routes for bTB
-> define what a spillover event is, how it distinguishes from a reservoir of infection. Reshift how we are thinking of this problem, perhaps break it down more.
-> Done by Monday Afternoon!
-> Script for each slides
-> practice with speaker notes on laptop
-> No need to talk about all the genotyping methods, just talk about Whole genome sequencing
-> Effects greatly several countries around the world, Multiple Hosts as background.
-> Cite the figures visibly!
-> highlight that core genes are important for bacterial functions. What's the difference between soft core genes and core genes.
-> for PCA, give very brief definition of PCA. Not so much math + history
-> what are orthologous genes? I never define them in the presentation.
-> How to identify PCA results,

-> create the pangenome repository!
DONE: Meeting with Liliana
TODO: Rethink the Goal of our research, why focus on genomic signatures of adaptation.
TODO: Notes of Pricipal Coordinate Analysis. Compile papers or consult a book?
