Fall 2020 Notes

Oct 8th
TODO: Investigate PC2 for Analysis
DONE: Investigate PC2 for Analysis -> I saved my results to investigatingPCA.Rmd

####
Oct. 5th
TODO: finish draft of presentation + practice
TODO: read a bit about loading analysis
-> Might be benificial to find the top 5% of factors and plot their direction in PC3 & 4?
TODO: do more research on pangenome PCA noise
-> From "Population Structure, Stratification, and Introgression of Human Structural Variation", it appears that the noise in PCs is due to assembly quality. something to check on
DONE: finish draft of presentation + practice
DONE: read a bit about loading analysis
DONE: do more research on pangenome PCA noise -> check if the values have anything to do with assembly statistics

Oct. 2nd
TODO: Rethink the Goal of our research, why focus on genomic signatures of adaptation.
-> So, what things improve if we have higher resolution genomic data of M. bovis?
-> From "Patterns and Processes of Mycobacterium bovis Evolution Revealed by Phylogenomic Analyses (Patane et al.)"
Disease control programmes based on regular tuberculin testing, and removal of infected animals (“test-and-slaughter”) have been successful in eradicating, or markedly reducing, tuberculosis (TB) from cattle in many countries, but these measures are less effective in countries with wildlife reservoirs of M. bovis (Cousins 2001; Miller and Sweeney 2013). The gold standard for postmortem diagnosis of bovine TB has been mycobacterial culture, although this method requires a significant amount of time (up to 90 days) (Lisle et al. 2008). This fact, together with economic globalization and the pressure from importing markets for a definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle that exhibit lesions compatible with tuberculosis and the advances in molecular biology, have provided a stimulus for improved TB molecular diagnostic techniques (Thacker et al. 2011; Araújo et al. 2014).
-> M. bovis evolution can lead to genetic variability which can lead to understanding transmission dynamics
-> What Scale does M. bovis evolution act on? country scale or the species population scale?
-> If genomes are more related on the country level, then clusters should align with country-of-origin metadata.
-> If genomes are more related on the species population level, then clusters should align with species metadata.

Oct. 1st
TODO: Meeting with Liliana
-> Title needs to be changed to "Characterization of Genome Signiture of Mycobacterium bovis"
-> Very busy slides, less text if possible
-> I don't discuss how animals become infected (goes before talking about reservoirs). Look up transmission routes for bTB
-> define what a spillover event is, how it distinguishes from a reservoir of infection. Reshift how we are thinking of this problem, perhaps break it down more.
-> Done by Monday Afternoon!
-> Script for each slides
-> practice with speaker notes on laptop
-> No need to talk about all the genotyping methods, just talk about Whole genome sequencing
-> Effects greatly several countries around the world, Multiple Hosts as background.
-> Cite the figures visibly!
-> highlight that core genes are important for bacterial functions. What's the difference between soft core genes and core genes.
-> for PCA, give very brief definition of PCA. Not so much math + history
-> what are orthologous genes? I never define them in the presentation.
-> How to identify PCA results,

-> create the pangenome repository!
TODO: Notes of Principal Component Analysis. Compile papers or consult a book?
